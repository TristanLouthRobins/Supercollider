# Supercollider
In 2023, I started re-learning SuperCollider. It's been a **very** long time since I last dabbled in it (c.2004) and I'll be using the weekly Disquiet Junto challenges to flex and develop my skills over the course of the year. Anything SC-related to my Junto output will land in this repo, along with anything else that I code that might be useful or interesting.
